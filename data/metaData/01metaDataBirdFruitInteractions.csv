"frequency","numeric","[interactions per 25 hours]","Interaction frequency","On each study site, we established one plot of 30 Ã— 100 m2 size and observed interactions of birds with fruiting plants using binoculars for 25 hours in total. We recorded the number of visits and the behaviour of each bird species on each fruiting plant species and considered only visits classified as legitimate seed dispersal events, i.e., swallowing or carrying away of seeds from mother plants."
