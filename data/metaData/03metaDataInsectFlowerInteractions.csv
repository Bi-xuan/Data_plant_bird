"frequency","numeric","[interactions per 4 hours]","Interaction frequency","On each study site, we established one plot of 100 Ã— 100 m2 size and (if possible) sampled each site several times. During each sampling round, we conducted a four-hour transect walk. During each transect walk, we moved slowly through the vegetation of each study site and recorded each interaction in which an insect touched the reproductive part of a plant species. Thus, we assumed that all flower-visiting insects contribute to pollination."
